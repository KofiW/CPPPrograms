/* This program will simulate the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, or Spock with the user. 

Based off the number the computer generates, I'll check to see which number its in. 

Let's say its one. I'll check to see if the user response is 3. If it is, the computer wins. If it isn't, the player wins. 

I'll just have an if statements for the other two conditions as well. 

Possibilites for winning/losing/drawing:
1 > 3
2 > 1
3 > 2
