#include <iostream>

/* The way I'm going to solve this is:

For each element/number of the index (i), I'm going to divide it by 3 at first and check the remainder to see if its 0 because if it is, I can THEN check to see if its also a multiple of 5 by dividing that index by 5. If it also is, I will replace the index with "FizzBuzz". 

If it's not a multiple of 5 but still remains a multiple of 3, I will replace the index with "Fizz".

If it's not a multiple of 3 to begin with, I can then skip to the check to see if its a multiple of 5, if it is, I will replace the index "Buzz".

If it's none of these 3, I will just output the number of index. */
